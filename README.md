#Frightened Rabbit

Just another OpenGL project using PyOpenGL and GLSL and PyQT4

See `pip_requirements`

Also need PyQT4. Because I am developing on OSX, I used [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) package manager:

```
brew install qt
brew install sip
brew install pyqt
```

(It may be wise to install PyQT4 before executing `pip install -r pip_requirements`)


I am also trying my best to comment methods and classes with [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpydoc)'s doc style (just for good coding commenting practice).
